# 专业课学习的内容
&emsp;离散数学（英语：Discrete mathematics）是数学的几个分支的总称，研究基于离散空间而不是连续的数学结构。与连续变化的实数不同，离散数学的研究对象——例如整数、图和数学逻辑中的命题——不是连续变化的，而是拥有不等、分立的值。因此离散数学不包含微积分和分析等“连续数学”的内容。
Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered "discrete" (in a way analogous to discrete variables, having a bijection with the set of natural numbers) rather than "continuous" (analogously to continuous functions). Objects studied in discrete mathematics include integers, graphs, and statements in logic.
随着计算机科学的飞速发展，离散数学的重要性则日益彰显。它为许多信息学课程提供了数学基础，包括数据结构、算法、数据库理论、形式语言与操作系统等。如果没有离散数学的相关数学基础，学生在学习上述课程中，便会遇到较多的困难。
Research in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in "discrete" steps and store data in "discrete" bits. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development. Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems.
# 学习重点是什么
数理逻辑(Mathematical Logic)
<br>
The study of computability theory in computer science is closely related to the study of computability in mathematical logic.Mathematical logic cna be divided into propositionnal logic(命题逻辑)and predicate logic(谓词逻辑)The proposition(命题)can take a "value",called the truth value.The truth value is only "true" or "false" kinda like "0" and "1" in bits which we can use em to judge the true or false of a sentence

集合(Set Theory)
<br>
集合论是研究集合的数学分支。集合是指一定对象的总和，例如：{蓝色，白色，红色}是一个有限集合；所有素数组成一个无限集合。 偏序关系和拥有其他关系特征的集合在多个数学领域都有应用。
Set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies set.Set refers to the sum of cetain objects for example:{blue,white,red} is a finite set;all prime numbers form an infinite set.Partial orders and sets with other relational properties have applications in several areas of mathematics.

例子：容斥原理(Inclusion-exclusion principle)
<br>
We define A and B are two sets,and the absolute value of the set are the elements in the set.The formula(表达式)expresses the fact that the sizes of the two sets may be too large since some elements may be counted twice.The double-counted elements should be deleted.Thus we subtract the intersection of A and B.Therefore we can promote it to three sets and more which become the principle.

图论(Graph theory)
<br>
图论是研究图和网络的数学分支，常被认为包含于组合数学中，但这一分支已经发展得足够庞大和有特点，并有自身领域所研究的问题，因此被视为一个独立的主题，在数学和科学的所有领域都有广泛的应用。
<br>
Graph theory is a brach of mathematics that studies graphs and networks.It is often considered to be included in combinatiorial mathematics,but this branch has developed enough and has characteristics,and its own research problems in the field,so it is regarded as an independent topic.has wide-ranging applications in all areas of mathematics and science.
<br>
For example:Dijkstra' algorithm.We use it for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph.We choose a node as a start and compare the weight to other nodes adjacent to the start node.Choose the smallest weight path and let the adjcent node become the start node.
# 专业课在某些领域的应用
Discrete mathematics is very important to the development of computer science because the objects in computer science is dicrete.We can say that the mathematical language of computer science is dicrete mathmatics.People will use the concepts and reprentation methods in discrete mathematics to study and describe objects and problems in all branches of CS.
