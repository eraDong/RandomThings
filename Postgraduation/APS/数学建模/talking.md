Mathematical modeling 数学建模

It's a practical lesson in the second year of college.Its aim is to build up students' sense about how to use a mathematics in real life though the application of buiding models.

In the first section of the lesson,a coach of the mathematical modeling team from our college will give three lectures about what is mathmetical modeling,the common algorithms in the mathematical modeling,how to use python/matlib to build simple models on the questions.

In the after-lesson section,we need to accomplish some tasks that given by the coach.

1. Monte Carlo Method 蒙特卡罗模拟方法
    Its main idea is to continuously sampling and gradully approaching the result（不断取样，逐渐接近结果）.We can use a example to explain this method:to caculate the area of the circle.we can sample about 100000 dots on a graph.Then we choose the dots that are in the circle and use it to divide the overall dots.As a result,we can get the approximate area of the circle.

2. Fitting 拟合
   Fitting is used in many fields such as machine learning,economy etc.Cross-over with machine learning.I learned about fitting more clearly.Fitting is that we use some train datas to build a function that can predict the result of the test datas.We also could give fitting a example:House price prediction.We can use the datas of the house price and the datas of the house size to build a function that can predict the price of the house.
