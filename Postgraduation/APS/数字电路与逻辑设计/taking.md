# What is Digital electronics and logic design

数字电路与逻辑设计包括了数字系统的基本知识，基本理论和常用的数字集成芯片。同学们可以学到基于数字逻辑电路的一般情况进行分析和设计。
Digital electornics and logic design contains the fundamental knowlege,therories, and commonly used digital integrated chips of digital system.Students can learn about how to analysis and design digital system based on the general situation of digital logic curcuit.

数字电路对于计算机来说，就是计算机的根基
Digital curcuit is the basis of computers.

## What do I learn

1. 逻辑电路 logic circuit

   Just as all the logic lesson in computer science.We get and/or/xor etc.We learn about how to use them in the digital logic circuit like how to display them.And how they work in the digital logic circuit.Give an simple example:Depending on the binary system,We can simply define high level as 1,low level as 0 so that we can use the logic system to drive the computer.

2. 半导体存储器 semiconductor memory

    RAM and ROM,this part showed how the computer use/store the data.RAM means Random access memory and ROM means Read only memory.We use RAM as the middle of CPU and data.Using RAM,we can exchange data fastly between bus and CPU.

    Rom is the read-only.So we seldom use it to exchange data.And it can be used in the mainboard.When the
    Manufacturer product a mainboard,they will store a bios in the ROM of the mainboard so that we can config our system in the bios like setup the windows/linux system.

3. 时序逻辑电路 sequential logic circuit

    sequential logic circuit means the input not only depend on the current input but also depend on the previous output.This is a big part of logic circuit.Filp-flop circuit（触发器电路）is the basic one.Digital clock is made by using the flip-flop circuit.We can set a time and press the buttom that the flip-flop will store the time,when the clock signal comes,the clock will remind u to wake up.
