# What is python programming

python是高级的，解释性的，交互性的以及面向对象的编程语言。python易于学习，包含许多第三方集成的库numpy pandas.
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented programming language.Python is designed to be easy to learn but it’s very powerful.It contains many third-party libraries such as numpy,we can use it to solve the linear math problems and pandas,we can use it to load the data and analysis it.

What is noteworthy is that python is the most used programming language in the world after statistics.And now I also regard python as my main language to work with the deep learning and AI field.

## What do I learn

Until now we have learned C,C++,JAVA so we have the basis of how to learning a new programming language.There are little diffrences between Python and the other languages.However I can still say some of them.

1. data structures

python provided three classic data structures: list, tuple and dictionary.They are very useful in the data analysis.list is the one we can modify the elements in it so that we use it to save and store.tuple is the one we can not modify the elements in it so that we use it to save the data.dictionary is the one we can use it to save the data and read it easily.

2. slice

slice is the operate we carry out on the data structure.With a colon we can slice the data into different shapes.The order of the parameters are row,column and steps.So follow this,[1:] means we only need the data from the second row.
