# WHEN

It's a lesson about learning the application of the theory of the engineer courses stared at sophomore year.It lasted for 2 weeks.

# WHERE

In the school.There is a production workshop(生产车间) that provided for students to have a simulated work environment.

# WHAT

We divide the preiod into 2 parts:One is the first week,another is the second week.

In the first week,we gathered together,like about one-hundred studetns,we have a class about how to using machine in a safety way.Then according to the diffierent classes and different majors,we divied into several groups to work with these machines.In the first week,our purpose is to make a hammer handle by cutting(切割),carving(雕刻),polishing(打磨).

In the second week,we stared to making the hammerhead.What impressed me at that time is the drilling machine.There was a teacher who led us to finish the high precsion(高精度) and dangerous job.By using different mold(模具).We cut the metal into a shape like hammerhead and drill a hole through it.At the last day,we assembled the hammerhead and the handle together.
