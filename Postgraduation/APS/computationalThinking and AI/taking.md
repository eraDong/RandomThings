# 专业课学习的内容
&emsp;This lesson gave me a very first impression on what a computer can do and how computers are infecting the whole world.At the beginning,it introduced the development of computer and things that computer can do.next,it talked about the key logic of computer - Electronic encoding(数字编码/編碼)and computer hardware like chips integrated circuit(IC集成电路),Von Neumann architecture(冯诺依曼结构),software like OS and database basically are the things that made computer.Let's go more deeper,it also talked about internet and the security of information that cause by the development of internet.Last two thing its about algorithm,i know it a lot cause i have som icpc experience and AI.
# 学习重点是什么
&emsp;This lesson is more like a liberal education(通识教育) lesson that taught a wide range.I think the most essential part is to learn about all the knowleges and have my personal perspective about Computer Science.How CS come into being or what's the whole industry's next step.
# 你认为这门专业课最重要的是哪些知识点
&emsp;I think the most important points are the structure of a computer and the logic behind a computer which makes me know why computer can save and process a large amount of data.Algorithm and programme language also my favorite,good algorithm can makes compter more effcient.
# 专业课在某些领域的应用
&emsp;It can be used in many fields,I can give some examples,like the Internet can be used as the media.As you can see,the producer of newspapers and magazines almost publish thier E-version,I mean Electronic version.Internet is just a monster that seized the position of the old media.Also computer vision is widly used in transportation.Computer can recognize the licence plate of a car and decide whether it will open the door.
