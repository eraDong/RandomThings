# What is Innovation and Entrepreneurship Practice

It is a lesson that taught us how to realize our thoughts in the field of business.And we have a peiod of 3 weeks to achieve the goal.And the students were divied into several groups.Each group contains about 8 students.Every Friday we will have a meeting to share the ideas and make a report to the teacher which is also the leader.

## What have I done

At that time I had a thought to design a website with the concept of web3,blockchain.In the first week,I proposed this idea to my tutor and received some useful ideas to perfect it.After meeting,I was going to code it in my personal computer.Before the second meeting I created a simple framework of the website to submit to the teacher.It was just like a normal bbs similiar to reddit and I promise to add the block chain part in the next step.Finally,The last meeting we all had a represetation of our ideas and the teacher would give us a rating of our ideas and the perfomance of our representation.
