# What is computer network?

计算机网络是一门研究计算机如何相互连接以交换数据、共享资源和促进通信的学科。
Computer network is a subject that studies how computers connect to each other to exchange data,share resources and facilitate communication.

扮演着重要角色，以及是现代计算机科学的基础。
This discpline(学科) plays a important role in the development of the Internet and is the foundation of the modern computer science.

# What do I learn

1. Protocol 协议

    协议是一组规则主导着计算机的连接
    Protocols are a set of rules that govern the communication between two or more computers.

    常见的规则有TCP,UDP等

    TCP面向连接 可靠 基于字节流

    UDP 无连接 不可靠 面向报文 通常在游戏中

    The common rules are TCP, UDP, etc.TCP is a protocol that Connection－oriented, reliable and based on the byte stream.UDP is a protocol that is not connected, unreliable and based on the package.UDP is usually used in the game server.We can always see package loss in online games.

2. Data Transmission 数据传输

    Data transmission is the process of transferring data from one computer to another.We'll have some experimental lessons to make the twisted pair network cable and use it in the local network to verify the connecitiy in a group.

3. Network security

   Network security is mainly about how to build and use the virtual network.While we were in a big company,we may use the virtual network for the works.The principle is that there is a encrypted channel(加密通道)which is used to send the data and the one who need to use virtual network must have the key and connect to the channel.
