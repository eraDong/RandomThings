# 专业课学习的内容
&emsp;Quoted by wiki,In computer science,a data stuture is a data organization,management and storage format that is usually chosen for (efficient access高速访问) to data.Therefore I have learned about how a computer storage,access and process data.Depending on diffierent ADT(abstract data type),we can process a large amount of data in millisecond speed.
# 学习重点是什么
&emsp;There are several points I have to pay attention to.Like,firstly/in the very beginning,I have to learn about what is data structure and how to assess a algorithm which is better or worse than the other.what's more,it's time to get start with some ADT,like list,stack,queue,tree,map which is very classic and the most basic that I must know them very well.Lastly,I learn some sorts and searching,I could say it's the application part of DS,These are wide-range using in computer science.
# 你认为这门专业课最重要的是哪些知识点
&emsp;What i think the most important knowledges are the ADT(s),list,stack,queue,tree and map.Learning about ADT not only learning about the usage but also comprehending about the mathematical logic in the bottom layer of the data stucture.
<br>
For example:
<br>
All the structures have CRUD(create,retrieve(检索),update,delete) which have the unique features of themselves.If we use a link-list to create an element.We imagine link-list as a link that we can create it into the head or the tail.If we use a tree.It is not like list.We imagine the structure as a tree and we push the element as a leaf under the root. 
# 专业课在某些领域的应用
&emsp;In computer science,I think DS is the most important lesson.In the developement of (information age)信息时代的发展下,the scale of data become larger and larger,Data structure give full play to the performance of computers help computers to deal with these large data in a very fast speed.And it can be widely used in medicine,mathematics,computerscience,finance and other fieds which have to process a great number of data every second.
