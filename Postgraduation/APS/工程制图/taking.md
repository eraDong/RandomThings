# 专业课学习的内容
&emsp;I'm major in CS thus this lesson(engineering drawing) is a simple version of the original one.I mainly learn about the basic points like how to draw,how to mark and how to recognize the simple workpiece(工件)
# 学习重点是什么
&emsp;The very important point is to see,understand and draw cuz there are lots of two-dimensional graphs that i can't recognize their three-dimensional figure.To see is to draw better.Another field is size mark and learn common standard of a workpiece.In China,it is called guobiao.
# 你认为这门专业课最重要的是哪些知识点
&emsp;I think the most important points are drawing the cutting of a cone,cylinder,and drawing screw thread.Different from the skills of drawing that we learn from our lives before.This two methods actually need some expertise skills to draw.Like line of intersection.
# 专业课在某些领域的应用
&emsp;It is a common lesson that should be used in many fields.Directly it is used in producing the workpieces of machine,building.If we attach it to CS,we can use a computer to draw and mark size of workpieces digitaly with the knowledge of engineering drawing.
