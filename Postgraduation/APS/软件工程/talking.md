# software engineering 软件工程

## 我学了什么

​	It is a lesson that we learned at the third year of college. This is lesson is not mainly about how to develop your code and it focus more on the procedure of developing a software in a group/company. It is really important because a commercial app not only depends on the effort of one person but the teamwork of the company. So they design a procedure.

​	In this lesson, we divide software development into three steps: requirements analysis, user story and design tasks of development.

## 重点是什么

1. requirement analysis

   ​	In order to design an app for specific users, we need to learn about the market and users. We need to write a documentation about what they need. For example, I've been through a practical training about how to develop a cashier system of a convenient store in a company.

   ​	We need to know how many users are in this system such as customers, shop owners and clerks. And we write down what they will do in this scene like pay, store things. Then we will start brainstorm and complete the documentation. It is a very important start.

2. user story

   ​	After we know the requirements of users, we can start design the stories. What is stories? we can understand it as who what why. We need to convert the requirements into Who done something and gain something.

   ​	Back to the example, in the cashier system. shop owners will manage the stock by using the app and he can see a list of goods. So this is a story. We need to claim everything clearly so that developer can understand it easily.

3. design tasks

   ​	After we get the user stories we need to design tasks for developer. At this stage, I am MDE in our group so my major task is to design tasks for every developers. We have a website for everyone so we need to put the tasks on the website. We need to write it clearly. I can give an example of a function "Search goods"

   ​	We need to claim where to put this function on. How users will use this function and what they will get the values.

4. git

   Git is that every developers use it for teamwork. Git has a tree to manage the edition of the software. Also it is annoying when developers are rookie. If they operate the tree incorrectly they will break some important information. 

   There are two important command:

   git push, this is used for push our code into the remote repository.

   git pull, this is used for pull the newest edition of the software after someone push the code.
