# 专业课学习的内容
&emsp;Obviously from the name of the lesson we can know that it is mainly talk about C programme language.C is the first programme language that i learn in college so teacher mainly teach us about the definition of varaible or sth basic.What's more,we step into the branch construct(分支结构)and loop structure(循环结构)which is very important for everyone to write effective programmes.Then we learn array,pointer,struct and file IO.So this lesson is mainly about C proramme language syntax(语法).
# 学习重点是什么
&emsp;I think the important thing is to write programmes when you are learning syntax.If you can programme and debug by yourself,it proves that you have already understood and mastered it.
# 你认为这门专业课最重要的是哪些知识点
&emsp;The hardest part of learning C programme language is pointer which is also the key difference between C programme language and the others.Pointer is very close to the logic of machine language which depends on the address to achive its function.IO is also a difficult part too which the syntax is too long to remember.
# 专业课在某些领域的应用
&emsp;C programme language is mostly used for the field of the connection of hardware and software like we can use C programme language to design a operator system or to do embedded development(嵌入式开发).More widely, C can develop database.MySQL,SQlite and Oracle all developed in the enviroment of C.
